# 🧠 Migraine Type Prediction Web App

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the type of migraine a user may be experiencing based on their symptoms. The app uses a trained Random Forest Classifier and provides personalized preventive recommendations alongside the prediction.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes various features like:

- Age, Duration, Frequency
- Symptoms: Nausea, Vomiting, Photophobia, Phonophobia, etc.
- Diagnostic labels: `Type` (e.g., "Migraine without aura", "Basilar-type aura", etc.)

> The dataset is loaded from a local CSV file:  
> `migraine_data.csv`

## 🧠 Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using `GridSearchCV`
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Label Encoding for categorical features
  - MinMax Scaling for numerical features
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20

The model is serialized using `pickle` for reusability.
